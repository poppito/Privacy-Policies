# Privacy policy
<br/>
<br/>



By using  this app, the user agrees to abide by the privacy policy and terms of service as described below.

This app is built with generative AI. Because App Store reviews can have a range of unfiltered content and these are largely the input, the app adjusts safety settings to a moderate level to balance results between relevancy and safety for each user.

The manufacturer of this app does not guarantee accuracy of the summarised reviews provided and the user accepts all liability for the output generated by these summarised reviews.

This app also uses device identifiers to verify non-malicious devices are accessing this app's services. These are not linked to the user in any way and are not used for tracking purposes.

Any usage information that is collected by the respective distributing App stores is in addition and is not managed by the manufacturer of this app.

The manufacturer of this app will always endeavour to update this policy when any changes are made to this app's functionality that impacts this particular privacy policy.
